          What is difference between var, let and const in JavaScript?

          <p>
            A variable declaration is simply telling the computer that a
            variable exists and what value it should start with. Similar to
            other programming languages JavaScript also allows for the
            declaration of variables.

          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="text-2xl">let:</span> The let keyword declares a
            block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
            Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the
            block.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="text-2xl">var</span> The var keyword declares a
            function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a
            value. Function-scoped means that the variable is only available
            within the function it was declared in. Global variables are
            available throughout your entire code.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="text-2xl">const:</span> The const keyword declares a
            block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that
            can’t be reassigned. Constants are also called “immutable
            variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually
            variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.

          <p>
            map() --> transform each item in an array and output to a new array
            without altering the original array. filter remove items of an array
            based on some criteria without altering the original array. forEach
            perform some function on each item of an array.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The filter() --> method in JavaScript creates a new array with the
            elements that satisfies the provided condition. This method calls a
            provided function for each element in array and verifies the
            condition given in the provided function and passes only those
            elements that satisfy the given condition.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            forEach() --> is used to execute the same code on every element in
            an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
            Example: In the example below we would use .forEach() to iterate
            over an array of food and log that we would want to eat each of
            them.

          What is the use of template string in JavaScript?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Template literals are literals delimited with backtick ( ` )
            characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation
            with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged
            templates.
